\section{Astrophysical Models}

To evaluate possible astrophysical explanations for the two \spock
events, let us first summarize the information we have:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Two events appeared in separate images of a single galaxy,
  separated by $\sim$120 days in the rest frame (240 days in the
  observer frame). \label{itm:TwoEvents}}
\item{Lensing models predict a time delay between the two host images
  of $\pm50$ days or less in the observer frame.}
\item{Each event lasted for $<$15 rest-frame days\label{itm:FastLC}}
\item{After correcting for lensing magnification of $\mu\sim30$, both
  events reach a peak luminosity of $\sim10^{41}$ ergs s$^{-1}$
  \textcolor{red}{(NEED TO REFINE THIS NUMBER)}}
\item{\textcolor{red}{ADD IN X-RAY AND GAMMA RAY CONSTRAINTS}}
\end{enumerate}

To explain the observation of two transient episodes in different host
galaxy images (item 1), there are three possible
scenarios:

\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
\item{A single physical event (e.g., a stellar explosion) that
  appeared to us twice with an intervening time delay due to strong
  gravitational lensing.}
\item{Two separate events from distinct sources (e.g., two explosions
  from unrelated stars).}
\item{Two separate events from a single astrophysical source (e.g., a
  recurrent nova).}
\end{enumerate}

The very rapid rise and fall of both light curves (observation 2)
is incompatible with any of the normal SN classes.  For both
thermonuclear white dwarf explosions (Type Ia) and massive star core
collapse explosions (Type Ib, Ic, and II) the optical light curve
after reaching peak brightness is primarily powered by the decay of
radioactive \NiFiftySix to \CoFiftySix, which leads to a minimum
decline rate of $\sim$0.1 mag day$^{-1}$.  For Type II SNe this decay
time can be extended into a plateau phase by the recession of the
photosphere via a recombination wave propagint inward through the
ionized H of the expanding outer shell.  In no case can a normal SN
powered by the \NiFiftySix decay chain exhibit the decline rate of
\TODO{measure the decline rate precisely} that has
been observed for \spock.

\subsection{A Single Explosion}

Any single explosion model (Scenario A) requires that the observed
transient events must be coincident both in space and time.  All
lensing models evaluated here agree that spatial coincidence in the
source plane is entirely plausible, but coincidence in time is highly
unlikely. For this scenario to be tenable, we would have to assume
that a large systematic bias is similarly affecting all of the lens
models.  While we cannot rule this out, it makes this single explosion
model significantly less tenable. 

Under this scenario, the optical observations in January, 2014 and the
infrared observations in August, 2014 are from the same explosion. At
redshift $z=1$ these translate to rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and
optical wavelengths, respectively, and in Figure \textcolor{red}{TBD}
we examine whether the observed colors in these bands are consistent
with the spectral energy distributions observed for known transients.
\todo{Line up the events at peak, measure colors, compare to SNe,
  novae, kilonovae, .Ia, and fast optical transients}.  We can not
compare the UV to optical colors, since that would require a
correction for differential magnification, and for this scenario we
have already assumed that the lens models are unreliable. \todo{Are
  the colors viable?}


\subsection{Two Explosions}

Invoking two separate and unrelated explosions (Scenario B) would
imply that the two events are {\it not} coincident at the source plane
in either space or time.  This relaxation of the time coincidence
requirement is consistent with the lens models, which makes this
scenario initially more attractive.  However, removing the spatial
coincidence is problematic.  All five lens models indicate that the
locations of the two events are within \TODO{How many arcsec?  how
  many pc?}.

\TODO{Evaluate the SED of this host galaxy pixel by pixel to determine
  whether the spock locations are consistent with being the same
  location on the source plane. }

Having two unrelated explosions occurring in the same
year within such a small physical area would be plausible if the
explosions were from a very common source, but the rapid light curve
already rules out all normal categories of supernova explosions.
Since we have not observed any similar fast transients in any other
galaxy throughout the Frontier Fields survey, to accept this scenario
we would have to conclude that the \spock host galaxy is a very
unusual physical environment that provided uniquely fertile ground for
such transients.

\TODO{Evaluate the star formation and metallicity of this host galaxy
  to determine whether the host is very unique.}

Nevertheless, let us accept the premise that this host has generated
two separate rare explosions in the same year, and consider what rare
explosion categories could be separately consistent with the observed
light curves.
