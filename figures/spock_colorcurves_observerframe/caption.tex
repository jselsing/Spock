Color curves for the \spock events.   Points plotted in the top panels show observed AB magnitudes for the \spockone and \spocktwo events from -3 days before the date of observed peak brihtness in each case.  Solid lines and shaded regions show linear fits to the data in the F814W, F125W, and F160W bands.  Bottom panels show the colors derived from the observed data, which are consistent with showing no color evolution over the rising portion of each light curve.
