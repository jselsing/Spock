\label{fig:PeakLuminosityDeclineTime}
Peak luminosity vs. decline time for \spock and other rapidly
declining transients.  Constraints for \spockone and \spocktwo are
plotted as overlapping colored bands, as in
Figure~\ref{fig:PeakLuminosityDeclineTimeWide}.  Two .Ia candidates
are shown as stars \citep{Kasliwal:2010,Poznanski:2010}, and arrows
indicate lower limits for two kilonova
candidates \citep{Perley:2009,Tanvir:2013}.  Grey bands show the MMRD
relation for classical novae, as in
Figure~\ref{fig:PeakLuminosityDeclineTimeWide}.  Circles mark the
observed peak luminosities and decline times for classical novae from
the Milky Way \citep{Downes:2000}, M31 \citep{Shafter:2011}, and the
local group \citep{Kasliwal:2011b}.  Black '+' symbols mark the 7 rapidly declining Recurrent Novae from our own galaxy \citep{Schaefer:2010}, and the large cross labeled at the bottom shows the rapid recurrence nova
M31N 2008-12a \citep{Tang:2014,Darnley:2015}.
