\label{fig:PeakLuminosityDeclineTime}
Peak luminosity vs. decline time for \spock and other rapidly
declining recurrent transients.  Constraints for \spockone
and \spocktwo are plotted as overlapping colored bands, as in
Figure~\ref{fig:PeakLuminosityDeclineTimeWide}.  Grey bands show the
MMRD relation for classical novae, as in
Figure~\ref{fig:PeakLuminosityDeclineTimeWide}.  Circles mark the
observed peak luminosities and decline times for classical novae from
the Milky Way \citep{Downes:2000}, M31 \citep{Shafter:2011}, and the
local group \citep{Kasliwal:2011b}.  Black '+' symbols mark the 7
rapidly declining Recurrent Novae from our own
galaxy \citep{Schaefer:2010}, and the large cross labeled at the
bottom shows the rapid recurrence nova M31N
2008-12a \citep{Tang:2014,Darnley:2015}.  Each orange diamond marks a
separate short transient event from the two rapid LBV outburst
systems, SN 2009ip \citep{Pastorello:2013} and
NGC3432-LBV1 \citep[a.k.a. SN 2000ch][]{Pastorello:2010}.  These LBV
events provide only upper limits on the decline time due to limited
photometric sampling.
