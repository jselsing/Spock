\label{fig:SpockDetectionImages}
The detection of \spockone\ and \spocktwo\ in HST imaging from the Hubble Frontier Fields. The central panel shows the full field of the MACSJ0416 cluster, in a combined image using optical and infrared bands from HST.  Two boxes in the main panel highlight the regions where the \spock\ host galaxy images appear.  The three host galaxy images (labeled 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3) are shown in two inset panels on the left.  Six panels on the right side show the discovery of the two events in optical and infrared light, respectively.  The top row is a template image, the center row shows the epoch when each transient appeared, and the bottom row is the difference image.
