\label{fig:SpockDelayPredictions}
Predictions for the reappearance episodes of both \spockone\ and \spocktwo\, due to gravitational lensing time delays.  The time delays are derived from four independent models of the \macs0416\ cluster, labeled by the modeler's last initial: D=Diego, J=Jauzac, O=Oguri, W=Williams, Z=Zitrin.  The top panel shows photometry collected at the NW position (host galaxy image 11.2) where the first event (\spockone, labeled spock1) appeared in January, 2014.  Optical measurements from ACS are in blue and green, and infrared observations from WFC3-IR are in red and orange, as in Figure~\ref{fig:LightCurves}.  Blue bars in the lower panel show lens models predictions for the dates when that same physical event (\spockone) would have also appeared in the SE location (galaxy image 11.1), due to gravitational lensing time delay.  The lower panel plots photometry from the SE position (11.1). On the right side we see the second observed event (\spocktwo, labeled spock2).  The red bars above show model predictions for when the NW host image 11.2 would have exhibited the gravitationally delayed image of the \spocktwo\ event.
