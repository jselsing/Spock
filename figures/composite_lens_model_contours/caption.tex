Probability distributions for the five primary magnification and time delay observables, drawn from the composite distributions of four lens models.  The time delays are both shown in units of days. Monte Carlo chains from the Jauzac, Oguri, Williams and Zitrin models were combined, with weighting applied to account for the different number of model iterations in each chain.  The contours shown in the ten panels at the lower left mark the 1-$\sigma$ and 2-$\sigma$ confidence regions in each 2D slice of the parameter space. Histograms at the top of each column show the marginalized 1D probability distributions, with dashed vertical lines marking the mean and 1$\sigma$ confidence region.   The table of values at the upper right reports those values for the means and standard deviations.
