Probability distributions for the five primary magnification and time
delay observables, drawn from a combination of results from four lens
models.   Contours shown in the ten panels at the
lower left mark the 1-$\sigma$ and 2-$\sigma$ confidence regions in
each 2D slice of the parameter space. Histograms at the top of each
column show the marginalized 1D probability distributions, with dashed
vertical lines marking the mean and 1$\sigma$ confidence region.  The
table of values at the upper right reports those values for the means
and standard deviations.
