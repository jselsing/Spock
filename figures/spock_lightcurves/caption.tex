\label{fig:LightCurves}
Light curves for the two transient events, \spockone\ on the left and \spocktwo\ on the right.  The flux values are rescaled to a zero point of 25 mag. Dates in the observer frame are marked on the top axis, and rest-frame time at z=1.0 is shown on the bottom axis.   As indicated in the legend, optical observations using the \HST\ ACS-WFC detector are plotted as circles in shades of blue and green, while infrared measurements from the WFC3-IR detector are plotted as red, orange and purple squares.
