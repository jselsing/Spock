One way to test whether the two transient events \spockone and \spocktwo are physically associated is to compare the properties of the \spock host galaxy at the location of each event.   To that end, we used the techniques of "pixel-by-pixel" SED fitting as described in \citet{Hemmati:2014} to determine rest-frame colors and stellar properties in a single resolution element centered at each transient location.  For this purpose we used the deepest possible stacks of HST images, comprising all available data except those images where the transient events were present.
