\section{Light Curves}\label{sec:LightCurves}

The two \spock\ events exhibited very similar light curves, as shown
in Figures \ref{fig:LightCurves}.  The January event, \spockone, rises
to peak luminosity and fades back to quiescence in only $\sim$7 days,
and the August event, \spocktwo, rises and falls in $<20$ days.
