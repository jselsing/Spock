\section{Astrophysical Models}

To evaluate possible astrophysical explanations for the two \spock events, let us first summarize the information we have:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Two events appeared in separate images of a single galaxy, separated by $\sim$120 days in the rest frame (240 days in the observer frame).} 
\item{Lensing models predict a time delay between the two host images of $\pm50$ days or less in the observer frame.}
\item{Each event lasted for $<$15 rest-frame days}
\item{After correcting for lensing magnification of $\mu\sim30$, both events reach a peak luminosity of $\sim10^{41}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ \textcolor{red}{(NEED TO REFINE THIS NUMBER)}}
\item{\textcolor{red}{ADD IN X-RAY AND GAMMA RAY CONSTRAINTS}}
\end{enumerate}

With these core facts in hand, we can now examine whether any known astrophysical transients are capable of explaining these observations.
